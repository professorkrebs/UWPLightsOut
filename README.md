# UWPLightsOut
The game Lights Out built in C# and UWP.


This project was built during a series of live streams and will always contain the most current code. I will also build a separate branch based on the code state at the end of each episode. So, the master will contain the most current and complete code while branches will contain the code as it existed at the end of the episode. To follow along with the live streams, you can follow ProfessorKrebs on Twitch and Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGKMC5tpWUTU-5jG10rKqzg)
